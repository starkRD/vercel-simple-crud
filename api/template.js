<span style="font-weight: 400;">A full-time professional illustrator who has worked on 45 children’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">picture books. The artist published a book in 2016  named </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Monsters Go Night-Night,” in which all the characters were inspired by monster drawings by their 5-year-old son. People loved these interpretations and to keep going artists asked their fellow artists to join and rework the original kid drawing in their own ways and share them online.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reactions afterward were so overwhelming that the artist dubbed the challenge </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Monsters Go” and continued to post a new monster prompt every week for the next three years. It was contributed by all their 6 children.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The artist love the idea and started their own project in which they continued alone and drew many artworks inspired by children's drawings. As a single artist in the project, they redrew the drawing submitted by kids. They named the project “Monsters Go”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People liked the idea so much and between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 to 2018, “Monster go” received more than 20,000 drawings from children. They redrew 300 of them. In 2019 they finished the challenge of redrawing their own children’s monsters.</span>
